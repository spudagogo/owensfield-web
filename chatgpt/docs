# Owensfield Community Platform — Master Pack v1 (Single Review Document)

**Purpose of this file:** one place containing (1) platform rules/spec, (2) roles & permissions, (3) workflows, (4) UI layout contract, (5) implementation checkpoints.  
**Editing rule:** if something is wrong, edit this file. Do not re-explain in chat.

---

## 0) Hard Non-Negotiables

- No discussion facility (no forum/comments/debate threads).
- Archive-first: things are **archived, not deleted**, unless explicitly stated otherwise (and even then, “delete” typically means archive + retain references).
- Governance changes require a poll and apply automatically on approval; logged and archived.

---

## 1) User States and Access Gates

### 1.1 User states
- Public (not logged in)
- Member (Inactive)
- Member (Active)
- RG Member (Representative Group)
- RG Member with **Elected Role** (Chair/Vice Chair/Secretary/Treasurer)
- Temporary Mode Authority (Chair and/or Vice Chair when RG < 4)

### 1.2 Inactive member restrictions (confirmed)
- Inactive members are **not available to member content**.
- Inactive members can access only:
  - Profile
  - Renewal/reactivation
- Everything else must be blocked.

---

## 2) Plots, Membership, Voting (Confirmed Rules)

### 2.1 Plots and voting value
- Number of plots is fixed.
- Each plot has **fixed voting value = 1**.

### 2.2 Split of voting value
The plot’s value (1) is split equally between all **active** people registered with the plot:
- 1–2 plot owners
- + 1 or more tenants
Inactive users contribute **0** (do not receive a share).

### 2.3 Joined plots (UPDATED)
- **More than two plots can be joined** and managed under **one membership**.
- Joining is assignable by RG admin.
- Voting value for a joined membership = sum of joined plots (e.g., 3 plots → value 3), split equally across all **active** registered people on that joined membership.

---

## 3) Membership Lifecycle (Confirmed)

- Membership renews annually from **scheduled AGM → next AGM**.
- Suggested membership fee exists but is not compulsory.
- Members are Active or Inactive depending on reactivation/renewal status.

## 4) Representative Group (RG) Structure (Confirmed)

### 4.1 RG membership size

- Vice Chair (single)
- Treasurer (up to 2)
- Secretary (up to 2)

Same person can hold multiple roles if required (not preferred).

### 4.3 Temporary Mode (Critical)
Triggered when RG < 4:
- Chair and/or Vice Chair gets full governance access and may authorise/override procedures.
- Purpose: avoid deadlock/system breakdown until RG returns to ≥ 4.

---

## 11) UI Layout Contract v1 (STRUCTURE ONLY)

**NOTE:** You said the previously “locked UI design” was wrong.  
This section is here so you can mark exactly what ordering/placement is wrong.

### 11.1 Global frame (intended)
- Logged-in experience has a consistent frame:
  - Primary nav
  - Main content
  - Contextual actions on relevant pages (e.g. RG tools)

### 11.2 Navigation by user state (INTENDED ORDER — EDIT THIS)
Active Member nav (proposed order for review):
1) Dashboard
2) Communications
3) Meetings
4) Polls
5) Governance
6) Documents
7) Finance
8) Noticeboard / Calendar
9) Profile

RG/Elected adds:
- RG area
- Pending approvals
- Membership database
- Plot tools
- Actions register
- (Treasurer-only finance upload controls)

Inactive nav:
- Profile
- Renewal

**ACTION FOR YOU:** If this order is wrong, rewrite it here. This becomes the UI authority.

---

Entities implied/required by your workflows:
- User/Profile

## 13) Implementation “Where We Are” (Use as checklist)

### 13.1 UI
- [ ] Navigation matches section 11 exactly
- [ ] Active vs inactive gating enforced
- [ ] RG vs elected-RG gating enforced
- [ ] Pages match workflows (polls, meetings, communications, docs, finance)

### 13.2 Governance workflows
- [ ] Suggest poll → pending approvals → activate with 4 RG → vote → close → archive
- [ ] Governance change auto-applies and logs + archives

### 13.3 Meetings workflows
- [ ] Create meeting → auto draft docs → approval → visible to members
- [ ] Agenda submission form → RG approval → add to agenda

### 13.4 Membership DB / plot tools
- [ ] Membership database visible only to elected-RG
- [ ] Profile deletion = user details removed; plot persists as unregistered
- [ ] Plot owner reassignment logged; requires external confirmation

### 13.5 Archive policy
- [ ] No hard deletes for governance records
- [ ] Archived items read-only except where 4 RG approvals allow change

---

## 15) Next Build Rule (So we don’t repeat yesterday)

From now on:
- Cursor must implement **only what is written in this file**
- If something is missing, it must be marked **TBD** in this file first
- No “nice looking” guesses
- No re-asking for the same info: the answer goes here once
